Anti-money laundering is intended to detect the use of cash or wire transfer for terrorism, drug sales, or other crimes.
Federal guidance on red flags for money-laundering includes the following scenarios:
“any funds transfers sent in large, round dollar, hundred dollar, or thousand dollar amounts.” This is called Rounding.
“currency deposits structured at or just under $10,000 to evade Currency Transaction Report filing.” This is called Structuring.
